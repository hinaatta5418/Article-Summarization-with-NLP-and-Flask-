Text Preprocessing and Summarization Project
- Overview
   - This project demonstrates text preprocessing techniques using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and text summarization using Hugging Face's transformers pipeline with the BART model (facebook/bart-large-cnn). It preprocesses raw text data from a CSV file, including lowercasing, punctuation removal, tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization. After preprocessing, it applies text summarization to generate concise summaries of the articles using a pre-trained BART model.

Preprocessing Steps
  -Lowercasing: Convert text to lowercase.
  -Punctuation Removal: Remove non-alphanumeric characters.
  -Tokenization: Split text into tokens using NLTK's word tokenizer.
  -Stopword Removal: Filter out common English stopwords using NLTK's stopwords corpus.
  -Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form using NLTK's WordNet lemmatizer.

Summarization Steps
  -Model Initialization: Initialize the summarization pipeline with BART model (facebook/bart-large-cnn).
  -Text Truncation: Truncate input text to fit within the model's maximum input length.
  -Summarization: Generate summaries using the pipeline with specified parameters (max_length, min_length, do_sample).

Results
  -The project generates summarized articles in CSV format (summarized_articles.csv) containing original articles and their respective summaries.
